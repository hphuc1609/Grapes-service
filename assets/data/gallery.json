    "description": "In August 2018 Old Compton Brasserie opened it’s doors to the vibrant streets of Soho with an avant garde design evoking a nostalgic nod to soho bohemia.  Working alongside local artists, Paradise concept was to strip back the existing shell exposing all ductwork, aged plaster and brick and to insert a floating mezzanine giving customers an authentic dining experience. With the use of delicate marble mosaic floors, soft leather upholstery and warm lighting techniques create an elegant transition from day to night with the unique concrete horse shoe bar becoming centre stage for cocktail theatrics."

    "description": "The bar once known as the Kingly Club, has had its fair share of scandal: it was one of the places cabinet minister John Profumo met call girl Christine Keeler in 1961, and has hosted the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Peter O’Toole and Audrey Hepburn. Its latest development sees it transformed into Disrepute or D.R.P, a members’ only bar incorporating a vaulted den of jewel-coloured upholstery, marble floors and polished brass accents. The concept originates from the sixties heyday, playing on its glamorous heritage with a avant garde twist creating cosy nooks for couples or pink vaulted ceilings for larger groups. Paradise worked with local branding consultancy Two Times Elliot who developed the complete rebrand of Disrepute to reflect the opulence of the interior concept. Branded notepaper encourages you to pass notes to strangers across the bar, whilst a logo embossed punchy green suede menu holder adds a delicate touch to the exclusive Soho basement bar."

The new addition to the Dirty Martini brand features sophisticated touches of leather, copper and marble amongst bespoke fitted lights and iconic artwork, such as the famous neon wings, to maintain the classic elegant touch that is evident throughout all of our designs for Dirty Martini UK.

Paradise divided the interior into high level drinking space, a mezzanine for all day dining and a hireable room for wine tasting. Using dynamic timber ceiling rafts, bold amber neon and vibrant heritage colours, the design creates a characteristic yet modern feel for the busy central London worker. In contrast to the ground floor restaurant and wine tasting room, the basement bar is rich in colour with warm mood lighting for a comfortable speakeasy atmosphere."

Many of our dishes are perfect for sharing because this is the way we love to dine out with our friends and family. This is the food we love. Our culture. Shared. We wanted to create a quality all day casual dining concept with a strong focus on speciality coffee. We wanted to embrace Scandinavian design and cuisine and, at the same time, to share a little of what we enjoy and how we enjoy it in the UK.Our story begins in Stockholm. Arriving in late March with rivers still frozen, clear blue skies, clean crisp air, amazing food, culture, design and so much innovation – this was to be the first of many trips to the Nordic region and the beginning of a beautiful journey that led us to the KuPP concept."
